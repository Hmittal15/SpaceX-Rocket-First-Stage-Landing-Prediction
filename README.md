# **SpaceX rocket landing prediction**
---------------------------------------

In this project, we will predict if the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket's first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this project, we will collect and make sure the data is in the correct format from an API.

# **Objectives**
* Make a get request to the SpaceX API. We will also do some basic data wrangling and formating
* Perform web scraping to collect Falcon 9 historical launch records from a Wikipedia page titled "List of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon\_9\_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches)
* Perform exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering using Pandas and Matplotlib
* Load the dataset into the corresponding table in an IBM Db2 database and execute SQL queries to find some crucial insights
* Design interactive visual analytics using 'Folium' package to mark all launch sites on a map, success/failed launches for each site, calculate the distances between a launch site to its proximities
* Find best Hyperparameters for SVM, Classification Trees and Logistic Regression. Identify best predictive model for problem statement
* Design a dashboard application using 'Plotly'
